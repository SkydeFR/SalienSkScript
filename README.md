### How to use this

1. Install PHP (yes, really)
2. Install and enable `curl` extension in PHP
3. Join https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamDB (needed to represent captures)
4. Grab `token` field (it looks like a hexadecimal string) from https://steamcommunity.com/saliengame/gettoken and put it in `token.txt` (replace all content there)
5. Run the script: `php cheat.php`
